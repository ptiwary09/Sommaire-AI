# Stripe Webhook Fix Summary

## The Problem
Your Stripe webhook was returning 200 status (success) but data wasn't being stored in the `users` and `payments` tables in your Neon database.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the essential webhook handling files were missing from your project:
- No API route to handle Stripe webhooks (`/api/payment`)
- No payment processing logic
- No database connection setup

## What I've Fixed

### 1. Created Database Connection (`lib/db.ts`)
- Set up Neon PostgreSQL connection using `@neondatabase/serverless`
- Added proper error handling and connection testing
- Environment variable validation

### 2. Created Payment Handler (`lib/payments.ts`)
- `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted()` function to process successful payments
- `createOrUpdateUser()` function with proper user management
- `createPayment()` function to store payment records
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Duplicate prevention logic

### 3. Created Webhook API Route (`app/api/payment/route.ts`)
- Handles Stripe webhook events
- Verifies webhook signatures for security
- Processes `checkout.session.completed` events
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Proper error responses to Stripe

### 4. Fixed Database Schema (`database/schema.sql`)
- Removed trailing comma from `pdf_summaries` table
- Added performance indexes
- Maintained all existing functionality

### 5. Added Configuration Files
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guide

## Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install @neondatabase/serverless stripe --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your actual values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key (starts with `sk_`)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Your webhook endpoint secret (starts with `whsec_`)

### 2. Configure Stripe Webhook
1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/payment`
3. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

### 3. Test the Webhook
When you process a payment, you should now see detailed logs like:
```
ðŸ”” Webhook received!
âœ… Webhook signature verified
ðŸ“¨ Event type: checkout.session.completed
ðŸ›’ Processing checkout session: cs_xxx
ðŸ‘¤ Creating/updating user: user@example.com
âœ… User created successfully
ðŸ’° Creating payment record
âœ… Payment created successfully
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: All database operations now have proper try-catch blocks
2. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs help debug issues
3. **Data Validation**: Checks for required fields before processing
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate payments and users
5. **Environment Validation**: Ensures all required variables are set

## Files Created/Modified

- âœ… `lib/db.ts` - Database connection
- âœ… `lib/payments.ts` - Payment processing logic  
- âœ… `app/api/payment/route.ts` - Webhook API endpoint
- âœ… `database/schema.sql` - Fixed database schema
- âœ… `.env.example` - Environment template
- âœ… `WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` - Setup guide

## Testing
The webhook should now properly:
1. Receive Stripe events
2. Verify signatures
3. Extract customer and payment data
4. Store users in the `users` table
5. Store payments in the `payments` table
6. Return proper responses to Stripe

Your PDF summaries functionality remains unchanged and should continue working as before.

## Troubleshooting
If you still have issues, check `WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps. The most common issues are:
1. Missing or incorrect environment variables
2. Webhook endpoint URL mismatch
3. Wrong webhook secret
4. Database connection problems

The webhook now has comprehensive logging that will help identify any remaining issues.
